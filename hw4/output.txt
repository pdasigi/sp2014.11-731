" asia could be up to some extent is protected , but she may not be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything , that will be able to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and the reduction of foreign capital inflows .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan , on the line and to civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators .
" these changes would undermine confidence in those who support our army , and will bring serious damage combat readiness . "
" although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to the опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether a letter to panetta or the latest warning senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from reductions , will see later .
at a press conference last week 's defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further -- troops from the shell , but without the core .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army , with barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said , in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects can face obstacles , including those that have already been tested , and some of the only in the early stages of planning .
halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , in order to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .

stories of fraud on the exams in school and college - it 's the usual thing .
mentors , who should be to teach the opposite , they send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
for one of the day , as studies show that , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the extensive and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lie more often than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas the women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when they try to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or demonstrate the " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman ... miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely .
someone could use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magical means , to expose the lies , but to master the skill to detect deception can be .

the first fear is the limitation of the border , where you can build .
" we need to think about the new urban planning tools , because the current [ with regard to the general capital plan ( gsp ) ] can lead to the real trouble . "
модоло recalls that already has a job , made outside кальсеролы , which " should not miss deaf ears " , although he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project , " from the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which sets the name of this part of the complex , as the rules of the competition lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountains , but there are no longitudinal , reading , to see and understand the region as a whole . "
on the other hand , the project for some , the gate could overlap on the programme and identifying with the project architect for the neighboring gate .

in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen for mixed with characteristics of the close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of molecules of hydrocarbons , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight - so - called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his typical вязкоупругое demeanor .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said an expert in the area of chemical engineering .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных , in the bitumen , and then спрессованных .
a movement of vehicles and latch efforts , it helps forces to be distributed on the road to cover very well .
on асфальтовом cover , he added , put the latest layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear and tear also requires the proper thickness , and you need to take into account the material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water penetrates the surface and it 's hard for her to go out there , it causes размягчение all sections of the cover and , therefore , education , yam .

between the magazine , a journalist _guido ойос кромос believes that the mistake females valle de cauca was that she has undergone major surgery .
her body has never been to her advantage , and here , she had been penalised for it .
so it or not , the fact is that today , мелины begins a year of the board , not as the queen , but as a princess , position , which allows her to represent colombia directly on one of the international competition , the organizers of the national contest .

if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of the emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting about the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which has disappeared from the environmental debate .
this is why germany is one of them in its decision to abandon its nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , is only a few of those , who strongly continues to their projects .
although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which it receives a 30 % of its electricity , and she was also the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price for the majority of french refuse to pay all the more , because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , she attracts a contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs , which may not be moved to another industry .

then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " do n't need foreign bricklayers , talents , and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
francois hollande , in his program was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will help solve our immigration problem " .
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified , in dynamic sectors , where training is not connected to the offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and it 's without taking into account the fact that the diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the organization of labor , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , was given exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but at the same time and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over its enemies , it is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first place is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we 'll win nothing , demanding a series of national referendums , organized by as the need and in хаотическом order .
there is no , we are dreaming not of the blade the guillotine , but on the implementation of the " joint , the clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from their own weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the entire europe was gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of its nations together with her .
because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this socialist proposals and jacques delors now require all of the european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in the life граздан , is a another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary to " create a " of republicans .
this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , real people 's european sovereignty .

analysis of the incidents calls pointed out several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but of course , we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before you talk about the operational cooperation between the aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more intense , " says кунле амуво , a nigeria researcher .
the international community , led by the washington now has put pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the boko haram , which creates problems .
it focused mainly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in the past christmas , she took on responsibility for the diluted share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another for one in abuja .
in august , the local office of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent .

kane has a few days , mitt romney , the distance , rick perry and other множат loud , but deprived of the details of the statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally a strong republican party .
mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from the " good old party , " has threatened to take on the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration as much as its industries in asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china , and the complex foreign policy , not the only candidate , was able to overcome position which indulging emotions .
but huntsman , who is held at the bottom of the ratings , remained неуслышанным .
romney also promised military strikes on iran , if the sanctions will not be able to stop its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the ranking candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the cases .
the texas governor rick perry , which supports israel and is committed to the military strikes on iran , says that he 's willing to use the american army against drug cartels in mexico .
