раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia can be up to some extent is protected by , but she ca n't be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union , had been severely undermined the european debt crisis in the past months .
in the europe debt crisis spawned fears that he once again lead the global economy to recession , and led to calls for leading developing economies come together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that , " india will all that will be able " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and inflows of foreign capital .
" we have a great challenge , and we must maintain a high level of growth , " .
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers on monday in congress , warning that the automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will bring financial chain reaction of the pentagon to fields of battle in afghanistan , on the line and civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry of " , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and will do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta senators wrote .
" these changes undermine the credibility of those who support our army and will seriously damage combat readiness " .
" although military financing in the foreign emergency operations not directly affected секвестром , military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff personnel will be reduced , that would lead to опозданиям with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be broken " .
" the consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will be the fastest decline in the united states as a world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we can live together , and it is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether a letter to panetta or recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls to the release of the pentagon from cuts , will see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may follow more -- troops with a shell , but without the core .
" this is a paper tiger , the army , with barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers that can accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory comments in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects can face obstacles , including those that have already been tests , and some only in the early planning stages .
an end to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say that it is vital the next step to improve and to counter potential threats , and china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines suggests , how serious are and повсеместны deceit and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania , was charged in лжесвидетельствовании because they allegedly hide that schlensker retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards has been charged with financial , during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
story of fraud on the tests in high school and college is the norm .
mentors , who should be taught the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
within one day , as studies show that , you can lie from the 10 to 200 times .
another study has shown that unfamiliar people солгали three times in the first 10 minutes and get acquainted with each other .
unlike in the room of the game , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research project , especially psychology and physiology .
not worth it from that draw the conclusion that liars to see and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that detection of lies - modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in our complex in the world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interview , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lie more often than introverts , that the men lie about yourself , while the women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe behind the позой , a laugh , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can to put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , change its position in a certain way , or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with that woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a complex question entirely .
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering the complicated issue : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill of fraud detection .

during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production regularly , not forgetting the most important need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
why germany is still one in my decision to abandon the nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , is just a few of those who strongly continue their projects .
although german model , based on a renewable energy , sometimes , as an example , reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which it gets 30 % of its electricity , it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon emissions and electricity prices 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and service of industrial equipment on the national territory , french companies are benefiting from low - cost electricity in europe .
price , which the majority of the french refuse to pay more because , they do not oppose this kind of energy , in principle .
heavily export - oriented , it has been attracting a contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved to the other industry .
any engineer - electrician will order epr , calculated , to work , sixty years , if the planned closure of his producer ?
development of the areva solutions with the low - carbon , nuclear and renewable energy , testifies взаимодополнимости sources .
in france , we have security body , which is edged and transparent over the existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
nuclear industry in the 50 years has endured three major incident .
at chernobyl reactor and the unforgivable device human error led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry will extract the lessons from this accident , learned of the previous two .
as it is all the experts in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift rivals areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden to the french society and french economy .
in her program of francois hollande was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration . "
as ian goldin and remind us economists jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data about immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of impact of immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors , where training is not with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity , between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to labor organization , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in the average of 150,000 euros .
referred to teeth , who used to scaring immigrants , give exactly the opposite effect .
democracy - this valuable purchasing ; but at the same time he and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , in a vote , and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a necessary condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become " an instrument of repression " , as republican said once the philosopher etienne вашро .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but first of all , it is political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding series of national referendums , organized by as needed and in хаотическом manner .
no , we are dreaming not edge the guillotine , but the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
whole europe subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and from the absence of solidarity .
many worried about the transfer of sovereignty europe , but the entire europe gradually losing its sovereignty , and with her , each of its nations .
because only joint work of europeans will be able to reduce the severity of the debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a long discussion of this supply socialists , and jacques delors everything now require a european economic government .
but to represent it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new stalemate .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary to " create a " of republicans .
it may only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe , on the political level , this popular european sovereignty .
indeed , the 2011 year end sales microprocessors ( 11 % growth of the world bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , surpassing , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million .
this year , the world will be sold to 460 million бесконтактных smart cards against 320 million a year earlier !
europe , which lagged a long time from the asia - pacific region , are now moving forward in the field of бесконтактных payment .

" two large organizations in france , promised in the future systematically to distribute among their clients ' bank cards , suited for non - use , " said gerard небуи , director - general of the visa europe france .

yesterday , a crédit agricole announced experiment , since december to june next year in the massacre .
confirmed long предполагавшиеся link between the terrorist group al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) , and nigeria sect boko haram .
" way , which use these two organizations , and reports to the secret service show that they are actively working , " he explained , without going into details .
among the wreckage , the remaining after the operation , french and нигерские , investigators found a few telephone sim - cards , belonging to terrorists .
analysis of the calls pointed out in several interlocutors , had in the mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but , no doubt , you have to wait for more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between the boko haram and aqmi . "
" for many years , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigeria researcher .
the international community led by washington now provides the pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the boko haram , which creates problems .
she aims mainly at the church , and bars , the authorities .
in the past christmas , it took responsibility for per share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then even the one in abuja .
in august to a local representative of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab are operating in kenya , boko haram is a new threat to the continent .
can weakened the crisis america lead the world with the help of the ordinary , or rather simplistic ideas ?
already several days after mitt romney , the distance , rick perry and others multiply loud , but without details of the statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally a strong republican party .
mitt romney , who has the best chances of the nomination from " good old parties " , has threatened to sue chinese complaint in the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration for their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china , and the only candidate , the complicated foreign policy , could not overcome stance that indulging emotions .
but the huntsman , who has been in the bottom of the ratings , has remained in неуслышанным .
romney has also promised to military strikes on iran , if sanctions wo n't be able to halt its nuclear program .
" if barack obama will be re - elected , they have will bomb " .
entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the rankings , candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of affairs .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and is committed to the military strikes on iran , says , that is ready to use us army against drug cartels in mexico .
all of this very far from the republican presidential candidate of 2008 , the john mccain , тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they resemble what obama himself was a drinker , and that he had to lower the tone in respect of the fight against terror .
after iraq , it 's not believes in military intervention that confused in the sand .
northern stream , with the new gates for the sign of russian gas to europe .
