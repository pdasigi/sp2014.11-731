" during the period of time in the business i constantly asked : " why do you do it ? " and the answers you invariably get by : " oh , it 's just done it . "

scalia and thomas lunch with opponents of the health care law , while the court considers the case
this incident took place in the last thursday , when all the nine justices met to discuss submitted for review by the petition .
judges have agreed to consider the process ; in fact , rotary debate of the duration of 5 1/2 hours are expected in march 2012 , and the outcome will likely become a hindrance in the presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time , will be a court decision .
law firm clement , bancroft pllc , was one of the nearly two dozen firms , which helped sponsor annual lunch of federalists , long the current group , constantly , the conservative legal principles .
yet another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which has enormous financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuits .
attended , among others , mitch mcconnell , the leader of the republicans in the senate and well - known enemy of the health care law .
nothing new : the two justices attend activities society federalists have for many years .
in fact , judges free from the code of conduct that regulates the actions of the low federal judges .
however , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two law firms in this case , as well as the company with large financial interests , was enough signal to the activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official shares to raise money with lawyers , which now considered in court . "
scalia and thomas is unlikely to pay attention to the critics who say they are very eager to mix business court фигурирующими in groups like society federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that this is the judge elena kagan raised ethical questions , not the scalia and thomas .

" effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry of , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine trust , those who supports our army and will do serious damage combat readiness . "
" although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff would be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "

" this is not an option , with whom we can live together , and this is not a solution , which we must impose . "
whether panetta letter or the recent warnings of senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for the pentagon from cuts , see later .
at a press conference last week , a defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what could be further -- troops with shell , but without the kernel .
" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained troops , able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .

a cursory glance at recent headlines shows how , serious and повсеместны deceit and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , since they allegedly hide that retired football coach raped kids .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged with in financial fraud during the campaign that associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud on the tests at the high school and college - standard deal .
mentors , who should teach the opposite , sends a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
during one day , as the research shows , you can lie from the 10 % to 200 times .
another study showed that unfamiliar people солгали three times for the first 10 minutes meeting with one another .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
not out of this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that liars notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which it is easy to learn how to identify lies - and which helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviews , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts , that men lie about yourself , then as women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lie to our partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe per позой that laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the top of his body , when trying to recall their history , they can to put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in speech : " i did n't have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or to repeat the question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification language " , when answering a difficult question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know . . . as far as i know . "
there is no magic to detect lies , but to master the skill detecting deception .

on the other hand , the great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - so that 's just a few of those who strongly to their projects .
though model of germany , based on renewable energy , sometimes in as an example , reality contradicts this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which it receives 30 % of its electricity , and she was also the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; because of what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
price , the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not object in principle , of this kind of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a contemporaries of specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved in another industry .
what engineer and electrician will order epr , calculated to work sixty years , if the planned closure of the manufacturer ?
development of areva decisions low - carbon , nuclear and renewable energy sources , shows about взаимодополнимости .
in france we have the security organization , which runs edged and a transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
within 50 years , a nuclear industry survived three major incident .
in chernobyl reactor and unforgivable human error led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry will lessons from the accident , learned the previous two .
as it is seen all the specialists in the field of energy , willing to build the reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift rivals areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from the may 23 , said that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for french economics , and for the french company .
francois hollande was in his program platitudes , saying that " joint efforts will solve our immigration . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей past data about the immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears of the immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace the local workers , especially skilled , provoking reduced wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most skilled in vibrant sectors , where training is not with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants , leads to that with the arrival of immigrants positively affects the salaries of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among the american nobel laureates large share of naturalized immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all based on immigrants ) .
according to the organization of labor , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs ) an average of 150,000 euros .
or teeth , which use to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable the acquisition of , but at once and fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , to arrange a vote and make it so directly as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a prerequisite for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once the philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are , is the economic crisis , but the first turn , this is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win , demanding series of national referenda , organized as required and хаотическом manner .
there is no , we are dreaming not of the blade the guillotine , but on the implementation of the " joint , the clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
all europe completely subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , is suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer of sovereignty europe , but the entire europe gradually lose its sovereignty , and with her each of its nations .
because only collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt each , from the markets and prepare for future by investing in it .
after a long discussion of this proposal socialists , and jacques delors all now requires the european economic government .
but to submit its own without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in граздан , is another madness and a stalemate .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary " create a " republican administration .
this can be done only by creating a more democratic european at the political level , present popular eu sovereignty .
in fact , 2011 will be 11 percent of sales growth of the world microprocessor ( bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to eurosmart , 6 thousand million .

among the wreckage and remaining after surgery , french and нигерские investigators found a few phone sim card belonging to the terrorists .
analysis occurred calls pointed to several interlocutors , in the , mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is step forward , but surely , you have to wait for the more reliable evidence , before we talk about operational cooperation between the aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from outside , and that it is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigerian researcher .
the international community , led by washington now has the pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to problems , which creates the boko haram .
she aims mainly in on the of the church , bars and the law enforcement authorities .
in the past christmas , it took responsibility for per share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе and then again for the one in abuja .
in august local office of united nations would become their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent .

mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from the " good old party , " has threatened to take on the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , migration is as much as their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only candidate , the complicated foreign policy , could n't overcome , which indulging emotions .
but huntsman , who is held in the bottom of ratings , the left неуслышанным .
romney has also promised the military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to halt its nuclear program .
if obama would re - elected , " they will be the bomb . "
entrepreneur херман kane , second in the rankings candidates , showed the daunting ignorance of matters .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and the strives for military strikes on iran , says that is ready to use us army against drug cartels in mexico .
all of this very far from republican candidate of 2008 , john mccain тяжеловеса foreign policy .
they like that obama himself was amateur and that he had to lower the tone with regard to the fight against terror .
after iraq do n't believe it to military intervention , that confused in the sand .
the north stream , new gates for entering russian gas for europe .

сигароообразный the device inside the pipeline is a 1 - metre diameter and presses forward flow of gas .
pipeline was designed for work in 50 years ago without the need any repair .
these five companies created a joint venture , called the north flow , which was assigned to build and operate gas pipeline .
gazprom then gave the company 's lease on the twenty years with the opportunity to extend the entire gas transportation .
gas pipeline construction financing was provided by 30 % shareholders and 70 % of banking loans .
